TITLE OPTIONS (pick one):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. I built a clipboard manager for macOS that's 100% local, AES-256 encrypted, and has zero network connections

2. After getting paranoid about clipboard managers phoning home, I built my own - Buffer is fully offline and encrypted

3. Free, open-source clipboard manager for macOS with enterprise-grade encryption and zero tracking

4. Buffer - A privacy-first clipboard manager for macOS (AES-256, fully offline, open source)

Hey r/macapps (or r/opensource, r/privacytoolsIO),

I built Buffer because I was tired of clipboard managers that either:
- Phone home with analytics
- Store your data in plain text
- Require subscriptions for basic features

**What makes Buffer different:**

- **100% local** - Zero network connections. Ever. Your data never leaves your Mac.
- **AES-256 encrypted** - Everything is encrypted before hitting disk. Key stored in macOS Keychain.
- **Unlimited history** - No arbitrary limits. Keep millions of items if you want.
- **Blazing fast search** - Full-text search with FTS5, fuzzy matching, regex support
- **Keyboard-first** - Shift+Cmd+C to open, type to search, Enter to paste
- **Free & open source** - MIT licensed, no subscriptions, no "pro" tier

**Security breakdown:**
| Feature | How it works |
|---------|-------------|
| Encryption | AES-256-GCM via CryptoKit |
| Key Storage | macOS Keychain |
| Network | Zero outbound connections |
| Analytics | None |

It automatically ignores sensitive copies from 1Password, KeeWeb, and other password managers.

Works on macOS Sonoma 14+.

Would love feedback from the community. And yes, you can audit every line of code yourself.
